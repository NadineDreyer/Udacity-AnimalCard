				<p>
					Boxers are fearless, self-assured, calm and well balanced. Although they pose no
					threat to their family,
					they’re often suspicious of strangers and know no fear when riled.
					Boxers are obedient, making them easy to train. Undemanding, clean and loyal, they are as suited to
					the role of family and companion dog as that of defence and utility dog.
